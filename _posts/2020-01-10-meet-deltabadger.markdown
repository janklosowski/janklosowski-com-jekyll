excerpt:	    "Deltabadger is a friendly dollar-cost averaging bot that works with cryptocurrency exchanges. It automates the process in a set-and-forget manner. At the moment, it supports Kraken and Bitbay (with Polish users in mind). It’s easy to set up, sends notifications when something goes wrong. It also offers a simple chart and CSV export fo those who enjoy looking at how their investment performs over time, because who doesn’t?"
