excerpt:	A few notes about why and where you should set up email on your domain. Freshly, after a violent breakup with my previous email provider.
---

Recently, I’ve experienced an upsetting [breakup with ProtonMail](https://x.com/klos/status/1838812841467613334), and I’ve made some changes to how I handle my mailboxes. Over the years, I've gone on quite a journey as an email user. Here are some lessons that may be useful to you:

Where to start… I love email.

It's a foundational protocol of the internet, older than the web, and my bet is: it will still be here when Facebook and Google Search no longer exist. So, get one—that’s for sure—and set it on your own domain. Yes, you need that too. Here are three reasons why:

## Independence
Owning an address in your domain allows you to switch providers anytime during your lifetime. Maybe you want to try out some new cool service like Hey, have concerns with Google’s privacy policy, or ProtonMail delivered a nightmare experience of over a week with no access to your emails. No problem! Move your mailbox somewhere else in a few simple steps, and none of your recipients will even notice. I went through letting everyone know that I changed my email address once, and it took four years before I stopped receiving emails at the old one.

## Branding
Email in your own domain is a statement—it’s like wearing stylish clothes. The domain can say something about you and immediately position you where you want to be. Even if it’s just your surname or nickname, it projects some level of independence and agency, making a good impression.When I receive professional communication from a @gmail address from an unknown person, it’s not a good look, which leads to the last point…

## Trust
The worst outcome of writing from a generic domain is looking untrustworthy. Whenever I receive professional communication from an unknown contact, I check the domain, I check the website, and I check the website’s ranking, or even google the brand. It’s a good way to filter out scams and quickly get a lot of context.

**Facts: I never reply to “gmails” offering services.**

When it comes to picking your "postman", let me share my experience:

If you need a business email that integrates with services like Zapier and Pipedrive—just go for Google Workspace. Your privacy is already compromised by connecting to third-party services, so at least make your life easier. I hired ProtonMail for that job for over 4 years, and all I can say: it's a lot of extra hustle.

For a long time, I recommended ProtonMail to everyone who asked. If encryption is your priority—go for it. If you plan to use it as anonymous/vanity address — even better. Unfortunately, despite the noble idea behind it, the quality of customer service suffers from bad corporate culture and it not sufficient for serious purposes. They don’t work on weekends, reply slowly, and it took weeks (!!!) of fighting until they restored access to my business mailboxes, lost due to an error on their payment page (the error was still there when I left). That’s way too much trouble to easily recommend them for serious users. 

**Tip: Download your emails locally.**

After the whole drama, for my private address, I eventually settled on iCloud, and after a few weeks, I’m quite satisfied. First, I appreciate Apple’s focus on privacy. In that regard, I trust them much more than Google or Microsoft. Second, like surely many of the readers, I use an iPhone and already pay for iCloud, which includes this option for free. With my fresh bruises from the ProtonMail "adventure", I'm devoted to store my emails locally, so here comes the bonus point: I tried the default Mail app, and it was surprisingly sufficient without adding further bloat to my setup.

**TL;DR: Email on your domain is more than just convenience — it’s about privacy, trust, and, well… looking good. Also: download your emails, stupid.**
